In Titan's Email Designer, users often hit a wall

“My brand color isn’t there.”
“I just want it to look good.”

But giving users full control like colour pickers for every text block, CTA, and background destroyed the design.
Most of our users weren’t designers. They did’t understand contrast, legibility, or aesthetic cohesion. Poor contrast, bad combinations = broken email layouts, unreadable text.

So I built a smarter colour system.
Just input one brand colour to get beautiful palettes (monochrome, complementary, triadic, tetradic etc.) generated using colour theory. No guesswork. No overwhelm. Just colours that work.
